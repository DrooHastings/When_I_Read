# When I Read

When I Read is a web solution that tackles two issues for the contemporary busy parent.  The first iteration offers a platform for which your child is able to sharpen their constructive phonics skills.     The ‘Word Master’ feature uses  engaging images to teach and reinforce letter pronunciation and spelling of simple words.  Words are broken down one letter at a time for easy practice.  This will require adult guidance, but will engage young readers through a flashy visual UI that will command their attention.
